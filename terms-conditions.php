                    <h3>Revision Policy</h3>

                    <p>
                        The authorised number of revisions depends on the package you chose, and you may request as many changes as are specified in the package's specifics. We put a priority on giving our clients the greatest services possible, and we'll keep revising until your needs are satisfied. If the design concepts remain the same, you are not obligated to pay more money. Within 48 hours, you'll receive a new version of your logo. While every adjustment to a website's design will be given within 24 hours and every revision to a website's development will be delivered within 24 to 48 hours (depending on the revision complexity). The turnaround time for revisions on illustrative logos (logos featuring an illustration element or an illustrated design) is 48 hours.
                    </p>

                    <h3>New Order Processing Time</h3>

                    <p>
                        Turnaround time is the period of time from when you provide your design concepts to your account area and when you make your package purchase. The turnaround time ranges from 24 hours to a maximum of 48 hours for all orders for new logos. The turnaround time is at least 48 hours from order confirmation and full brief submission for packages with four or more logo concepts. Additionally, the minimum turnaround time for new website designs (home/index, including redesign designs), after order confirmation and complete brief submission, is 48 hours. Please be aware that the turnaround time for developing a static website with five to seven websites is three to five business days. For all Friday and/or Saturday orders, the delivery period begins on Monday. The first concept for your chosen illustrative logo (logos with an illustration element or an illustrated design) will be sent within 48 to 72 hours of order confirmation.
                    </p>
